# lsw1.dev
lsw1.dev is a React website built with Typescript and Vite. This site is being developed as an alternative to database sites like Speedrun.com. The goal of this project is to use modern web technologies to deliver a better UX and faster performance for speedrunning leaderboards. More documentation and code comments are the main focus as of now so forks for other games that want to move away from SRC can be made quickly.

# Credits
lsw1.dev would not be possible without modern web technologies like React and Vercel. Tons of credit goes to the teams for making web development more accessible. You can find more info at https://react.dev
I also wanna give a huge thank you to the Catppuccin community, the color scheme of lsw1.dev makes heavy use of the mocha pallete. You can find resources and ports at https://github.com/catppuccin
